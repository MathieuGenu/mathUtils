mathUtil
================

mathUtils gather a bunch of useful function for package development,
script, etcâ€¦

## Installation

The best way to use the package at its full capacity is to install the
package with vignette that describe how to use functions. To do so :

``` r
devtools::install_github("MathieuGenu/mathUtils", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Use of functions

If documentation does not describe in a proper way the use of a
function, it must be documented in the vignette. To consult it :

``` r
library(mathUtil)
vignette(topic = "mathUtil")
```
